  brief: Education in India from perspective of a student. Few burning questions - What it is? Is it all? and a plug for an EdTech venture.

Over the past 12 months, while trying to solve the problems of the education sector in India, I came to know that Department of School Education & Literacy, MHRD is aimed to provide compulsory education to all children at elementary level. ₹69,074 crore was spent on education in year 2015–2016 and 22% increase is expected this year. Programs like “Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,” “Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan,” “Scheme for Strengthening Teacher Education” and half a dozen more are undertaken, to improve education quality.  

So, education is pretty important. But, the question, “What is education?”, is still unanswered.  

Simplest thought, **_We learn stuff at school. So, education is learning._**
