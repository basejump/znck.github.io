Over the past 12 months, while trying to solve the problems of the education sector in India, I came to know that Department of School Education & Literacy, MHRD is aimed to provide compulsory education to all children at elementary level. ₹69,074 crore was spent on education in year 2015–2016 and 22% increase is expected this year. Programs like “Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,” “Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan,” “Scheme for Strengthening Teacher Education” and half a dozen more are undertaken, to improve education quality.  

So, education is pretty important. But, the question, “What is education?”, is still unanswered.  

Simplest thought, **_We learn stuff at school. So, education is learning._**  

And, it intrigued me to know, “Is education learning?”.

Formally, **Acquisition of knowledge, skill, values, beliefs, and habits** is learning. That makes pretty much everything “a learning”.

Habits are primordial. Beliefs are known to exist for thousands of years. We acquired skills since the beginning of time. I am not wrong to say, “Learning existed since the beginning of time”.

Consider every experience of life, a learning, and it is. Over the brief history of time, life learnt to emerge in approximately 4 billion years. In next 475 million years, our ancestor (apes) walked the earth. We learnt to control fire in 23 million years. We learnt to write in mere 2 million years and print in few thousand years. Mathematics and Astronomy; we learnt them in just few centuries, Electricity and Communication; in a century or two, Technology; in few decades. And today we have a technologically advanced and connected world.

> Learning is result of a curious being. It is intrinsic, active and spontaneous.

So, this is learning or may be not. But, a more important pattern is evident.

“Learning is catalysed by technology and technology is advanced by learned.”

But when did education came in picture. More important, “What is education?” And I google it, “The process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university.” I deduce, may be some time ago, we learnt to share our learning, that would have formalised into education.

Education! Whatever! But, there are many social and technical issues in the education sector. E.g.: not accessible to everyone, rote memorisation, promotes rat race, untrained teachers, lack of resources, social and parental pressure for financial stability, reservation. Its very difficult fix them all at once. But, for sure, with technology, we could fix them faster.

Education is primary necessity. In this world, the digital world, learning have become complicated. Proper compartmentalisation is required. The (education) system should be more efficient, modern, adaptable and flexible.

(May the knowledge became brilliant)

Education system could become brilliant with automation and digitisation.

And here’s my pitch:

We, at Scalex Systems, are spending sleepless nights to make the digital dream of India come true. A giveback from graduates of Indian Institute of Technology, the digital infrastructure for every educational institute — Zero.

Coming to the question; Is it all? We may find out soon!

Stay Tuned!
