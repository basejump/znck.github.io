User could add multiple instances of same service. So, I hacked up some logic with jQuery and selectors. All cool! ready for production.\n\nBut next they added a summery view of selected services. And guess what! modifying services in the summery view should update in original listing. Somehow we did it but it created a mess of events, callbacks and selectors that could fry up brains of best developers. Something was needed to be done at least for sake of next developer who would fight in with my dirty code.\n\nNext, I started looking for MVVM libraries and apparently to us Angular was the most popular one. Understanding all that ng-* stuff was way too complex and infeasible to implement in just one page. Alternative? Yep a week long hunt for alternatives.\n\nClicking through links on blogs & StackOverflow some how reached to Vue.js repository. With a scroll through the docs, I was writing Vue components. Best part was I didn’t have to change anything, just added Vue to one page without any change in app structure. In couple of hours, it was ready. There were no unexpected bugs. Code was clean & understandable. And it took me couple of hours to implement everything (if you exclude time wasted in looking for Angular alternatives). Beautiful! isn’t it?\n\n## Thank you Angular!\n\nIf Angular wasn’t that crapy & rigid back then I couldn’t have found Vue. The time wasted in looking for Angular alternatives is the best wasted time of my life and it was Angular that made me love Vue.\n\nThanks a lot!
