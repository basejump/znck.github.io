If you need a build tool then scaffold a repository using `vue build` tool. Following is a step by step process I follow when creating an issue:\n\n### To create a repro on jsfiddle\n\n- **Start with a template:** You should use a template, it saves time and better than an empty screen to get started. Use template ([https://jsfiddle.net/39epgLj0/](https://jsfiddle.net/39epgLj0/)) from Vue’s contribution guidelines.\n- **Write minimal code:** If your fiddle has few lines it is more likely to be solved faster, as it is easier to comprehend small code and issue is already isolated all we have to do is find the cause. You can start pasting the code from your project and strip off all unnecessary stuff and then replace the data with fakes.\n- **Explicitly define dependencies:** Jsfiddle allows you to add external dependencies but rather you should add a script tag with [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/) link.\n- **Follow coding style:** If every one follows same code style then cognitive friction of reading others' code is reduced. [Pablo Henrique](https://github.com/pablohpsilva) has prepared an [extensive code style guide](https://pablohpsilva.github.io/vuejs-component-style-guide/), you should follow that.\n  > I am also trying to formulate interoperability standards that would cover code style and component API. The project have just started. You can keep an eye on progress (star & watch [https://github.com/znck/vue-interop](https://github.com/znck/vue-interop)).\n- **Add comments:** Describe your intent in code. Comments guide readers to understand your code better and be on same page as you’re.\n  I’ve created an example fiddle demonstration.\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/znck/hm2sfh4r/embed/\"></script>\n\n### To create a repro repository\n\n- **Use Vue build tool:** You can create zero configuration development setup using vue build. Go through documentation ([https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/master/docs/build.md](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/master/docs/build.md)) to know more.\n- **Include README.md:** Describe your issue briefly and provide steps to produce the issue. Following is an example README.md\n  ```markdown\n  # Issue: rollup build fails when shared cache\n  When using the rollup option `separateCaches` to speed up successive builds for `gulp.watch`, \n  I get an error on each rebuild. On the first run it builds successfully because `separateCaches` is `undefined`.\n\n  ## Steps to reproduce\n  - Run `gulp watch`\n  - Update something in a .js file\n\n  > Related issues: #55, #97\n  ```\n- **Push to Github:** Create a github repository and push the repro code.\n\n### To create an issue\n\nAlways follow contribution guidelines. I know it’s really difficult to read a large article when you’re stuck with an issue. That is why Vue.js team is experimenting with a tool to help users to create issues. It is not in production yet but you can use the prototype ([http://vue-issue.surge.sh/](http://vue-issue.surge.sh/)).\n\n","rendered":"<h1>Fiddle with Vue.js</h1>\n<p>If you’ve created an issue on Vue.js repository for the first time then there is high probability that you skipped reading the contribution guidelines.
